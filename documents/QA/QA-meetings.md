# 1. QA Team 5-Minute Meeting 

## Meeting Date and Time: 2023-11-17 15:30 PM

## Objective: Quick update and coordination between QA and Dev Team.

### Content:
How to optimize code commenting for enhanced understanding?
- Provide a concise one-line comment for each function, specifying the registers they will utilize and the purpose of the function.
- Detail the effective usage of the wiki for comprehensive code documentation.
- Establish a dedicated page on the wiki for each function and seamlessly link it within the code.
- For functions with intricate logic, directly create documentation on the wiki and integrate links within the code.

### After-Consequences:

The team is expected to implement the optimized code commenting practices discussed, ensuring clarity and accessibility. Additionally, the utilization of the wiki for thorough code documentation, including individual pages for functions and specific documentation for complex functions, should be seamlessly integrated into the development workflow. This approach enhances code readability and supports ongoing collaboration within the team.

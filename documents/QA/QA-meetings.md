# 1. QA Team 5-Minute Meeting 

## Meeting Date and Time: 2023-11-17 15:30 PM

## Objective: Quick update and coordination between QA and Dev Team.

### Content:
How to optimize code commenting for enhanced understanding?
- Provide a concise one-line comment for each function, specifying the registers they will utilize and the purpose of the function.
- Detail the effective usage of the wiki for comprehensive code documentation.
- Establish a dedicated page on the wiki for each function and seamlessly link it within the code.
- For functions with intricate logic, directly create documentation on the wiki and integrate links within the code.

### After-Consequences:

The team is expected to implement the optimized code commenting practices discussed, ensuring clarity and accessibility. Additionally, the utilization of the wiki for thorough code documentation, including individual pages for functions and specific documentation for complex functions, should be seamlessly integrated into the development workflow. This approach enhances code readability and supports ongoing collaboration within the team.

# 2. QA Team 5-Minute Meeting 

## Meeting Date and Time: 2023-11-21 13:30 PM

## Objective: Code Quality and Code Review Discussion

### Content:

- The Dev team currently follows the practice of using a single branch, "dev," for coding, which may not be optimal. We recommend adopting a strategy of using different branches for various code components and merging them into the "dev" branch after a thorough code review. 
  
- It has been observed that the Dev team is building upon the code of Gary Iglesias rather than focusing on the project itself and initiating coding with best practices. 
  
- Additionally, the Dev team is not entirely comfortable with GitHub, and the QA team suggests enhancing their Git knowledge for smoother collaboration.
  
- The Dev team will begin populating the wiki with the templates provided by the QA team, who will concurrently start drafting test cases for the project. 
  
- Discussions regarding the wiki's purpose aim to establish a consistent architecture between the wiki and the code for better comprehension.

- Guidance on creating and responding to GitHub issues will be provided to facilitate effective communication within the team.


### After-Consequences:

- **Branching Strategy:** Implemented a multi-branch coding approach, using distinct branches for different code components and merging into the "dev" branch after thorough code reviews.

- **Coding Focus:** Transitioned from building upon Gary Iglesias' code to a dedicated focus on the project.

- **GitHub Proficiency:** Initiatives launched to enhance the Dev team's proficiency in GitHub, aiming for improved collaboration and utilization of Git functionalities.

- **Wiki Population:** The dev team will actively populate the wiki with templates provided by the QA team.

- **Test Case Formulation:** The QA team initiated the development of test cases for the project.

- **Architecture Consistency:** Ongoing discussions to align the architecture between the wiki and the codebase.

- **GitHub Issue Guidance:** Introduction of guidance on GitHub issue creation and response.

# 3. QA Team 5-Minute Meeting 

## Meeting Date and Time: 2023-12-1 10:00 AM

## Objective: Team Coordination 

### Content:
- Developers struggle to work cohesively, leading to project issues, notable consequences include code duplication and project slowdown.
- Essential project functions lack documentation and sharing.
- Developers express discomfort with Git.

### After-Consequences:
- **Code Management Strategy:** Implemented code pooling on a dedicated Git branch, aiming to improve collaboration and alleviate code duplication issues.
- **Documentation start:** Developers took the initiative to update documentation for critical functions.
- **Git Usage Enhancement:** Initiated fine-tuning for Git usage to enhance developer comfort and enforce best practices.

# 4. QA Team 5-Minute Meeting 

## Meeting Date and Time: 2023-12-7 10:00 AM

## Objective: Code Sanitization

### Content:
- **Branches to Delete:**
  - Ghost-AI
  - maze_to_back_buffer_ben
  - movement-on-key-release
  - collisions

- **Branch "maze" Status:**
  - Branch "maze" is significantly behind the current codebase.

- **Code Sanitization:**
  - Comments must provide meaningful insights beyond what is evident in the code.
  - Variable names need to be clearer.
  - Enforce naming conventions for casing and style.
  - Group similar elements together, especially in the constants file.
  - Remove debug code once its purpose is fulfilled.

- **Pull Request Review Process:**
  - Two reviewers for pull requests in both the main and dev branches.
  - Reviewers include 1 QA and either the project manager or the tech leader.

- **Code Merge:**
  - Merge entry.asm and main.asm for streamlined code organization.


### After-Consequences:
The identified branches have been successfully deleted. The "maze" branch has been updated to align with the latest codebase. Code sanitization efforts are underway, emphasizing meaningful comments and improved variable naming. The team is committed to adhering to naming conventions and organizing code more systematically. The two-reviewer system for pull requests in the main and dev branches has been implemented, involving 1 QA and either the project manager or the tech leader. The merging of entry.asm and main.asm has contributed to a more cohesive codebase. These actions collectively aim to enhance code quality and collaboration within the development team.

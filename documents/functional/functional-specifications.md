## Evaluation criteria

When evaluating a Pac-Man-like game or a game in the maze-chase genre, you can use several criteria to assess its quality and overall gameplay experience. Here are some evaluation criteria to consider:

### Gameplay Requirements

- **Movement and Responsiveness:** The character's movement speed must be precisely 60 pixels per second. Player inputs for movement must result in immediate and responsive character actions.

- **Winning and Losing Conditions:** Winning the game should be achieved by consuming all the dots within a level. Losing conditions must be triggered when "Pac-Man" either exhausts all lives or is captured by an enemy.

- **Level Progression:** The game must feature progressively challenging levels. Initial levels should present uncomplicated mazes with fewer enemies, while later levels should introduce more intricate mazes and faster enemies.

### AI and Enemy Behavior Requirements

- **Enemie Intelligence:** Enemies should exhibit intelligent behavior, using pathfinding algorithms to pursue "Pac-Man" logically. Their movements should dynamically respond to "Pac-Man's" position.

- **Fairness and Challenge:** Strive to maintain a balanced and challenging gameplay experience. Enemies should be swift and pose a challenge without causing undue frustration for the player.

### Controls and Responsiveness Requirements

- **Control Response Time:** The game should acknowledge player inputs with minimal delay. Specifically, key presses must be recognized within 50 milliseconds of being executed.

### Graphics Requirements

- **Visual Quality:** Visual elements, including character sprites, animations, and maze designs, should be visually appealing and run smoothly. There should be no graphical glitches during gameplay.

### User Experience Requirements

- **Menu and Transitions:** Menu transitions and animations must provide a seamless user experience. Transitions between menus and screens should not exceed 200 milliseconds to ensure a fluid feel.

- **Replay Value:** Encourage replayability through features such as high-score tracking and the inclusion of hidden bonuses within mazes, motivating players to revisit levels.

### Bug-Free Gameplay Requirements

- **Collision Detection:** The game should undergo rigorous testing to ensure it is entirely free from gameplay bugs. Specifically, collisions between "Pac-Man" and enemies must be detected accurately without any hitbox discrepancies.

### Player Feedback and User Satisfaction Requirements

- **Overall Satisfaction:** Above all, the game should be designed to satisfy and engage players. Ensure that players find the game enjoyable, reminiscent of the classic Pac-Man experience, and worthy of replay.

## Solution overview

### System architecture

As requested by ALGOSUP, we are going to use DOSBox, an emulator for Intel 80386 family CPUs which is cross-platform and does not require any DOS distribution or an x86 architecture CPU.
Our game will be based on a 16 bits adress bus, limiting adressable RAM to 65,536 bytes.

### User interface

### Game mechanics

As we need to respect the original gameplay rules, we have to be focused on many aspects during development:

- Graphisms: This includes sprites for both pac-man and ghosts, as well as map elements such as walls, pallets and bonus fruits
- Map creation and gestion: This includes creating a map, managing pellets, fruit cycles and other hazard on the map
- Gameplay: This includes moving, life system, score system and changes between levels
- Moving: This includes both pac-man and ghosts deplacements and collision
- Sound: This includes musics and sound effects
- Score: This includes score storing and keeping high scores

#### Graphisms

The game will take place on a [maze](docs\pictures\maze.png) of a size of 240 by 320 pixels

Absolutely, let's provide more concrete details and examples for the gameplay mechanics:

---

### Gameplay

#### Player Controls

- The player will control Pac-Man using the keyboard arrow keys:
  - Up Arrow: Move Pac-Man upward.
  - Down Arrow: Move Pac-Man downward.
  - Left Arrow: Move Pac-Man to the left.
  - Right Arrow: Move Pac-Man to the right.

#### Movement

Pac-Man moves through the maze at a rate of one cell per frame. Each frame is rendered at 60 frames per second, ensuring smooth movement.

#### Interactions

- **Eating Dots:**
  - Small dots (pellets) are strategically placed throughout the maze. When Pac-Man comes into contact with a dot, it is immediately consumed, and the player's score increases by 10 points.
- **Power Pellets:**
  - There are four power pellets located at the corners of the maze. When Pac-Man consumes a power pellet, it gains the ability to eat ghosts for a limited duration of 10 seconds.
- **Ghosts:**
  - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are the four ghosts that roam the maze. Each ghost has a unique movement pattern:
    - Blinky: Directly targets Pac-Man.
    - Pinky: Tries to position itself in front of Pac-Man's path.
    - Inky: Combines elements of Blinky and Pinky's behavior.
    - Clyde: Switches between random movement and targeting Pac-Man.
  - If Pac-Man collides with a ghost while not under the effects of a power pellet, Pac-Man loses a life.
- **Fruit (Optional):**
  - At certain intervals, a fruit bonus may appear in the maze. When Pac-Man collects the fruit, additional points are awarded.

#### Game Rules

- **Scoring:**
  - Small dots: 10 points each.
    - Power Pellets: 50 points each.
    - Eating a ghost (while under the effects of a power pellet): 200, 400, 800, 1600 points (depending on consecutive ghost eats).
    - Fruit (if implemented): Varies based on the type of fruit.
  - **Level Progression:**
    - Each level starts with a new maze layout. The difficulty increases as players progress through levels, with faster ghosts and more complex mazes.
  - **Extra Lives:**
    - Pac-Man starts with three lives. An extra life is awarded upon reaching 10,000 points.

#### Winning and Losing Conditions

- **Winning:**
  - The player wins the game by clearing all levels, demonstrating proficiency in navigating the maze and outsmarting ghosts.
- **Losing:**
  - Pac-Man loses a life if it collides with a ghost without the effects of a power pellet. The game ends if all lives are depleted.

#### Game Over Screen

When the game ends, the player is presented with a game over screen displaying their final score, along with options to restart or quit.

## Risks and assumptions

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| :----: | :------: | :-------------: |
| Scope creep   | We might try to make the project too big which could lead to the project running out of time. |  We must plan our work by doing a breakdown of the different tasks in sub-tasks and estimate a specific time which will be dedicated to this sub-task realisation.|
| Technical issues   | Assembly, which is the language used during this project, is part of a niche for development as only a few software developers are still using this low-level language. This explains why only a few people is our team already know how to code in depth with it. For this reason, many bugs or crashes could happen during the project realisation, mainly caused by memory leaks.| These unexpected behaviour must be found and patched as reliability and user friendliness are the key-points of a non-necessary software such as a video-game to keep users interested. However, patching behaviour issues might be challenging as we may encounter errors which have not been previously documented.|
|Copyright issues| Even if the project consists in recreating a retro video game which will not be published, copyrights must be taken into account as the risk of a software still being under license is not negligible.| As a consequence, we must ensure which assets can be used or not. This includes the game and the level designs, the sprites or the music. We must ensure the license of the original game is allowing us to use these resources. In case a resource is not usable, we will have to recreate it from scratch. For the graphic parts, we must choose differents colors and shapes, and for musics, we need at least to edit slightly the melody.|

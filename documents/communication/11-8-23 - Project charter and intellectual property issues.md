Hello.
We are sending you this email to inform you that our project charter is ready for review. It is available [here](../Project%20charter.md) and also as an attachment.

We would like to draw your attention to the second risk, about copyright and trademark issues. Indeed, you instructed us to "recreate the classic Pac-Man". Would this be a copy of the original with additional content or a completely new version with only the basic game mechanics remaining?

In the case of a copy, there are three courses of action we can take:

- Accept the fact that there might be a legal dispute, knowing that there are few chances for the right owners to see our work.
- Hide the project's content by making the repositories private, hiding it from the public.
- Use different assets we would have created ourselves, only keeping the base concept of Pac-Man. It would be closer to the "reinvent" part of the project but would lose on the original game.

We will adapt our specifications to your additional requirements. I am at your disposal if you would like to talk about the matter more.

Sincerely,
Léo CHARTIER, Project manager of Team 4

Hi Léo,

Thanks for raising the legal issue but I think it is safe to assume that this is a non-issue. It’s not a commercial project and it’s for students to learn. Nobody in their right mind would object to that, it would be bad publicity. Pac-Man is a classic so it makes it a tribute more than a copy.

I would advise you not to put email addresses in a public document. GitHub id is superfluous too as your are all member of the project so it’s easy to find you.
The description of responsibilities could be improve. Nobody in charge of risk management? Isn’t client satisfaction everybody’s job? Is no bug realistic? Are bugs the only thing that can go wrong with the code? Who is doing architecture? Etc.

Email is probably not the right way to do it as only I have access to it (the reviewers of the project won’t). Either do minutes of every interaction and put in on GitHub, use GitHub issues or Slack to communicate.

Otherwise, the document is a good step in the right direction.

Well done,

Franck

Thank you very much for the quick answer and feedback. I will edit the document later on and share the feedback with the team.

Have a nice day.

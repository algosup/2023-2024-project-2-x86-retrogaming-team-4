Hello Franck. Long time no see.

I hope you are doing well because we do.

We are glad to inform you that the prototype you requested is ready and available on our GitHub repository.
You can quickly access it from this link: <https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-2-x86-retrogaming-team-4/releases/tag/v0.3>.

Please bear in mind that we are still working on many features that did not make it in this version. We are actively working to finish and add them in.

We are waiting for all your feedback and additional requirements that you could have from playing this version of the game. As always, I remain available if you have any questions regarding its usage or the project.

I hope you will have a fun time playing with our prototype,
Antoine PREVOST, Program Manager of Team 4

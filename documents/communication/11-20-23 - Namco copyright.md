Hello,
I'm a student at ALGOSUP, a French computer science school, and we're currently working on a project to recreate a Pac-Man game in Assembler and with a computer emulator from the 80s.

Under French law, it's allowed to use the game's name and characters for school purposes, provided that the integrity of the game and its creator is preserved (Article L121-1 and Article L122-5 12° from the "Code de la propriété intellectuelle"). But my project team wanted to ask you for official authorization to carry out this project.

I look forward to your reply and wish you good luck.

Kind regards.

Grégory Pagnoux

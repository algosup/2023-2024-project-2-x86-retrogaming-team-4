# Pac-Man recreation

The project is a recreation of the classic Pac-Man in assembly x86 on DosBox.

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is the final code and executable file. We will hand over a prototype to ensure we are still on track.

Additionally, many documents will be provided to the client. Those include:
- Functional specifications
- Technical specifications
- Test plan
- Management planning

Finally, a presentation of our work will be done to the client in the form of a 15 minute presentation.

## Risks

- Implementations difficulties
  - Our software engineers are juniors, and Assembly is not an easy language. They could have too many problems implementing the code, leading to delays.
  - Probability: High
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Reschedule tasks of other members
- Copyright
  - The artworks of Pac-Man are copyrighted, and Pac-Man is also a registered trademark. Recreating the game could lead to heavy lawsuits if actual rights-owners hear of this project.
  - Probability: Low to medium
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Acceptance ? (to be discussed with the client)

## Budget

Money: Free  
Workforce: 7 team members  
Worktime: 24 half days of 3h30

Estimated total human-hours: 588h

# Weekly Report - Week 6

We are only one week away from the end of this project and there are still things to do. This week, we focused on improving what we had on the prototype and adding the different features that are still missing.
We were supposed to have six half-days of work but two of them were replaced with classes.

## Accomplishments

1. Animations
   - We now have different animations, ranging from Pac-Man's mouth to the ghosts blinking during freight time, as well as the death animation.
2. Ghost movement
   - We implemented an algorithm to automatically move the ghosts within the maze. The algorithm is incomplete and will have to be finished next week.
3. Score and life display
   - Since we already had the score stored in a variable, we started the process of displaying it onto the screen. The algorithm for the display is still under development and will have to be finished next week.

## Challenges

1. Waiting for other people code
   - As the tasks given are related one to antoher and can have influence, we have to define precise variable names and how the functions will work. However, we sometimes also have to wait for other's code as they are impactful on other parts of it. This can lead to some delays.

## Plan for next week

1. Presentation
   - As next week is the last week, we will have present our product and whole process of creation from the beginning of the period. We will have to create the pitch deck and train on it.
2. Finished product
   - The deadline for the product submission is fixed on Thursday, December 18th. We will have to finish our Pac-Man clone for this date and focus on development in the first half of the week.
3. Reviewing
   - We will need to have a unified codebase and test all the features defined in the different specification documents. In addition, edits to some of the documents about different bonus additions are planned.

## Conclusion

This week marks the last full week of development and makes us optimisitic about giving a working faithful clone of Pac-Man in Assembly x86. Next week will be the time to summarize and polish our product with even some bonuses added.

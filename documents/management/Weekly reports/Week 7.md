# Weekly Report - Week 7

This week was intense and marked the finalization of our Pac-Man version. We went through the week preparing our presentation and polishing the final details of our software.

## Accomplishments

1. Ghost behaviours
   - Previously, the ghosts were simply moving back and forth between the edges of the screen without colliding with the walls. Their AI has been completed and they now move through the maze, following Pac-Man as in the original game.
2. Presentation
   - As planned, a presentation of our project was to be made in front of the client and a jury. We prepared a pitch supported by a deck in the form of slides. Most of the week was spent rehashing and polishing our texts. The end result was more than satisfying and we are now waiting for the client's complete feedback.

## Challenges

1. Deadlines
   - The ghost behavior is one of the most important features of the original Pac-Man which is why we could hardly do without it, but it is also one of the most complex and time-consuming tasks. Since we were so tight on time, we had to work even harder and were not able to perfect it like the original one, having to leave out a few details.
2. Illnesses
   - We are deep in the middle of winter right now, and it comes with its share of viruses and bacteria. Some of our members were contaminated, sometimes forcing them to stay home, slowing down the overall work.

## Plan for later

1. Post-mortem
   - Now that the project is finished, we can look back on it and draw conclusions. We will have to define a time to meet again and figure out what went right or wrong about this project, the improvements that could be made, and the things to learn from it.
2. Improvements
   - The end of the project time does not mark its death. We will keep working on it during our free time to polish the things we didn't have time for and add some additional features we planned in the beginning.

## Conclusion

At last, all things must come to an end. The team is happy with the work it did and it appears the client is also satisfied from what we gathered at the presentation. We look forward to see where this project could go in the future and are eager to see what the road ahead has for us, always trying to go far while learning from our mistakes.

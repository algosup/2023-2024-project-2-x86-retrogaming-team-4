# Weekly Report - Week 3

The project has exited its third week, which was mainly a continuation of what was started the previous week.

## Accomplishments

1. Technical specifications
   - As the deadline for the technical specifications approaches, the document is nearing completion. It will be reviewed by the team tomorrow and polished before sending it to the client.
2. Movements
   - The input handler is now complete, and, thanks to the modularity of the display system, the movements have been quickly implemented as well. We are now able to move Pac-Man around with the arrow keys, although it still needs to follow the lines of the maze.
3. Timer
   - There is now a timer that allows us to define a framerate to the game, and thus, precisely control the movements of the player and ghosts. It has not yet been included with the rest of the code, but this should be done shortly, either in the 5th week or if possible before.

## Challenges

1. Timer
   - The complexity of the Assembly instructions made the timer creation quite a challenge. Thankfully, the restriction on the hardware being removed allowed us to access a new functionality that made this process much easier.
2. Communication
   - All 7 of us are working in a single room. This facilitates communication as we simply need to ask each other directly when something is needed. As such, written communication is often disregarded. Here are some notable points:
     - The tasks' statuses are often not updated.
     - The different conversations are not centralized.
     <!-- - I wanted to write a third point by I forgot what -->

## Plan for next week

1. Quality improvements
   - Additional meetings will be held to ensure that everything runs like clockwork, with regular verifications from the project manager and quality team.
   - Some of the aspects to tackle include naming conventions and file structure, task repartition, and communication.
2. Maze & collisions
   - As far as the code is concerned, the main point to tackle now is the creation, display, and collision detection of the maze. Pac-Man should move smoothly in there without any major issues by the end of the week.
3. Management
   - The managerial documents are almost complete. The risks and assumptions will be moved over from the functional specifications, and some mistakes fixed such as the dates not having the correct hours on the planning.

## Conclusion

We are still ahead of schedule. After dealing with a few problems that could hinder the project, we should be on track toward a good final product with, hopefully, a prototype ready to be delivered earlier than expected, providing us more time to respond to the feedback.

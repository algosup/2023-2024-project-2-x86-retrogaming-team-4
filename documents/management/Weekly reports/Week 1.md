# Weekly Report - Week 1

This first week was focused on the initialization of the project and the planning of it. We also started doing research for the code and the different questions we had. There were also a few interactions with the client to ensure the quality of our work.  
One thing to point out is the fact we had additional time provided due to one of our teacher being absent.

## Accomplishments:
1. Kick-off
    - The client presented us with the project and what he is expecting of us.
2. Specifications
    - We currently have most of the functional specifications ready and started thinking about the technical ones.
3. Planning
    - The different tasks required for this project have mostly been defined. The timeline has been defined but not written down yet.
4. Research
    - The software team has researched Assembly, NASM and DOSBox, the language and tools we are required to use. They successfully managed to run a "Hello World" and draw a square on the screen.
5. Test strategy
    - A good project cannot go smoothly without testing. Our QA team defined a strategy for testing with the different tools and tasks they will do.

## Challenges
1. New team & roles
    - This project started with a brand new team. Additionally, half of the team is composed of new students. Learning about each other is key to working correctly together.
    - Each person has been given a role, forcing us to learn about it and set ourselves in the correct mind, even harder for the new students who never did anything like this.
2. Legal matters
    - Creating a Pac-Man clone can pose some copyright and trademark infringement issues. This issue has been resolved by the client who informed us that they were accepting the risk.
3. Learning Assembly
    - Most of our team members never did Assembly. Learning it and more importantly, managing to think correctly about how to use it is quite a challenge, even with a book provided by our school director specialized in our project.

## Plan for next week
1. Finishing functional specifications and planning
    - The functional specifications must be completed (yet subject to changes as it is a living document) by Monday midday and sent to the client. One of the missing sections is the planning which should be completed by that time.
2. Drawing sprites
    - Since we are already able to draw on the screen, the next step is to draw sprites. One of the keys to do so is finding the right balance between screen size and color range, and later how to store the sprites in memory.
3. Risk evaluation
    - One of the priorities for next week is finding and defining in more detail the different risks that could occur during this project and how to handle them.

## Conclusion:

This project started off well and by working enough we should be able to meet the deadline, perhaps even having time to implement additional features.  
We are confident about the future and eager to see how this project will turn out and what we will learn from it.

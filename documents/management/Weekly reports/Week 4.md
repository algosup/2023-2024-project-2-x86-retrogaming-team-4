# Weekly Report - Week 4

The end of this fourth week marks the halfway point of this project. We lost the lead we had and are now slightly behind schedule.

## Accomplishments:
1. Test plan
   - The QAs' test plan should now be fully complete, a full week ahead of the deadline.
2. Code documentation
   - The development team created some documentation files on our GitHub wiki as well as some conventions. This then made it easier to merge their code.
3. Documents
   - Both specifications documents have been reworked to include missing details. Those include animations, licensing, sound generation, file architecture, and typo fixing.
   - The management documents should be complete and only need to be polished by merging them into a single document and adding graphs to the KPIs for example.

## Challenges
1. Conventions
   - As mentioned before, having two developers work separately made it harder to merge the code afterward. This is why we had to put conventions in place as well as documentation of the main function to ensure an easier flow of the work.
2. Difficult tasks
   - The main issue of this project is the complexity of having new students work on difficult tasks with a language they don't know. This makes the planning and repartition of the tasks difficult to do, but also their completion is a challenge for our developers.

## Plan for next week
1. Maze
   - The maze should have been finished this week with working collisions. This will have to be finished by the end of next week, in preparation for the first prototype required by Monday 11th.
2. Tasks
   - The project is starting to sink. To counteract this, the tasks will have to be redefined and reassigned from scratch, by correctly assessing where we are now and the things to be done with the knowledge and manpower we have available.

## Conclusion:

The delays are starting to appear and the employee satisfaction has dropped significantly. All the more reason we must prevail and keep adapting ourselves to make sure we deliver the best product we can.

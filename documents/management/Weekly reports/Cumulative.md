# Weekly Report - Week 1

This first week was focused on the initialization of the project and the planning of it. We also started doing research for the code and the different questions we had. There were also a few interactions with the client to ensure the quality of our work.  
One thing to point out is the fact we had additional time provided due to one of our teachers being absent.

## Accomplishments:
1. Kick-off
    - The client presented us with the project and what he expects from us.
2. Specifications
    - We currently have most of the functional specifications ready and started thinking about the technical ones.
3. Planning
    - The different tasks required for this project have mostly been defined. The timeline has been defined but not written down yet.
4. Research
    - The software team has researched Assembly, NASM, and DOSBox, the language and tools we are required to use. They successfully managed to run a "Hello World" and draw a square on the screen.
5. Test strategy
    - A good project cannot go smoothly without testing. Our QA team defined a strategy for testing with the different tools and tasks they will do.

## Challenges
1. New team & roles
    - This project started with a brand new team. Additionally, half of the team is composed of new students. Learning about each other is key to working correctly together.
    - Each person has been given a role, forcing us to learn about it and set ourselves in the correct mind, even harder for the new students who never did anything like this.
2. Legal matters
    - Creating a Pac-Man clone can pose some copyright and trademark infringement issues. This issue has been resolved by the client who informed us that they were accepting the risk.
3. Learning Assembly
    - Most of our team members never did Assembly. Learning it and more importantly, managing to think correctly about how to use it is quite a challenge, even with a book provided by our school director specialized in our project.

## Plan for next week
1. Finishing functional specifications and planning
    - The functional specifications must be completed (yet subject to changes as it is a living document) by Monday midday and sent to the client. One of the missing sections is the planning which should be completed by that time.
2. Drawing sprites
    - Since we are already able to draw on the screen, the next step is to draw sprites. One of the keys to do so is finding the right balance between screen size and color range, and later how to store the sprites in memory.
3. Risk evaluation
    - One of the priorities for next week is finding and defining in more detail the different risks that could occur during this project and how to handle them.

## Conclusion:

This project started off well and by working enough we should be able to meet the deadline, perhaps even having time to implement additional features.  
We are confident about the future and eager to see how this project will turn out and what we will learn from it.

# Weekly Report - Week 2

This second week was quite short (only two half-days) but on the flip side, we had a lot of courses on Assembly, which will help us greatly in making a qualitative project with the current timeline.

## Accomplishments:
1. Functional specifications
   - As required, we delivered the functional specifications to the client. Although they deemed the document not detailed enough, we have all the necessary information required to recreate a fidel copy of the original as requested.
2. Quality strategy
   - The QA team also continued their work on the testing plan and started applying their different strategies such as their weekly meeting.
3. Management
   - On the managerial side of things, the breakdown of the tasks and their planning is complete. The focus has been shifted to the Key Performance Indicators and the evaluation of risks.
4. First code
   - Thanks to the courses we had, we were able to write some code for our project during the classes (outside of our regular work schedule). This code has been tailored to our needs and is already available on the repository. We are now able to show any of the sprites anywhere on the screen.

## Challenges
1. Difficult project
   - With our lessons on Assembly, we realized that this project is actually more challenging than we originally thought.
   - Some aspects of the game we did not think about at first came up. The tasks we adjusted to reflect this, notably, a timer will be implemented soon to ensure the game runs at the right speed, which in turn will ensure the sprite's movement and animations will be flawless.
   - The main weak points of each team member came to light. Those will be treated or worked around with a close follow-up to have a smooth-running team.

## Plan for next week
1. Finishing technical specifications
   - Even if a bunch of progress was made on those, there is only one week to finish those. They will be one of the priorities of this week.
2. Player movement
   - Thanks to our great courses, we are ahead of schedule on the development side. The tasks that will be worked on are the movement of the player which requires the keyboard inputs to be read and the timer to wait the correct amount of time.
3. Management
   - As mentioned above, one of the goals for the following week is to have all the KPIs and risks fully defined.

## Conclusion:

Even though the functional specifications were not very well received, we are not letting ourselves be affected by this setback and will be making the most of the little advance we have.  
There is still a lot to be done but it is only the beginning of this journey.

# Weekly Report - Week 3

The project has exited its third week, which was mainly a continuation of what was started the previous week.

## Accomplishments:
1. Technical specifications
   - As the deadline for the technical specifications approaches, the document is nearing completion. It will be reviewed by the team tomorrow and polished before sending it to the client.
2. Movements
   - The input handler is now complete, and, thanks to the modularity of the display system, the movements have been quickly implemented as well. We are now able to move Pac-Man around with the arrow keys, although it still needs to follow the lines of the maze.
3. Timer
   - There is now a timer that allows us to define a framerate to the game, and thus, precisely control the movements of the player and ghosts. It has not yet been included with the rest of the code, but this should be done shortly, either in the 5th week or if possible before.

## Challenges
1. Timer
   - The complexity of the Assembly instructions made the timer creation quite a challenge. Thankfully, the restriction on the hardware being removed allowed us to access a new functionality that made this process much easier.
2. Communication
   - All 7 of us are working in a single room. This facilitates communication as we simply need to ask each other directly when something is needed. As such, written communication is often disregarded. Here are some notable points:
     - The tasks' statuses are often not updated.
     - The different conversations are not centralized.
     <!-- - I wanted to write a third point by I forgot what -->

## Plan for next week
1. Quality improvements
   - Additional meetings will be held to ensure that everything runs like clockwork, with regular verifications from the project manager and quality team.
   - Some of the aspects to tackle include naming conventions and file structure, task repartition, and communication.
2. Maze & collisions
   - As far as the code is concerned, the main point to tackle now is the creation, display, and collision detection of the maze. Pac-Man should move smoothly in there without any major issues by the end of the week.
3. Management
   - The managerial documents are almost complete. The risks and assumptions will be moved over from the functional specifications, and some mistakes fixed such as the dates not having the correct hours on the planning.

## Conclusion:

We are still ahead of schedule. After dealing with a few problems that could hinder the project, we should be on track toward a good final product with, hopefully, a prototype ready to be delivered earlier than expected, providing us more time to respond to the feedback.

# Weekly Report - Week 4

The end of this fourth week marks the halfway point of this project. We lost the lead we had and are now slightly behind schedule.

## Accomplishments:
1. Test plan
   - The QAs' test plan should now be fully complete, a full week ahead of the deadline.
2. Code documentation
   - The development team created some documentation files on our GitHub wiki as well as some conventions. This then made it easier to merge their code.
3. Documents
   - Both specifications documents have been reworked to include missing details. Those include animations, licensing, sound generation, file architecture, and typo fixing.
   - The management documents should be complete and only need to be polished by merging them into a single document and adding graphs to the KPIs for example.

## Challenges
1. Conventions
   - As mentioned before, having two developers work separately made it harder to merge the code afterward. This is why we had to put conventions in place as well as documentation of the main function to ensure an easier flow of the work.
2. Difficult tasks
   - The main issue of this project is the complexity of having new students work on difficult tasks with a language they don't know. This makes the planning and repartition of the tasks difficult to do, but also their completion is a challenge for our developers.

## Plan for next week
1. Maze
   - The maze should have been finished this week with working collisions. This will have to be finished by the end of next week, in preparation for the first prototype required by Monday 11th.
2. Tasks
   - The project is starting to sink. To counteract this, the tasks will have to be redefined and reassigned from scratch, by correctly assessing where we are now and the things to be done with the knowledge and manpower we have available.

## Conclusion:

The delays are starting to appear and the employee satisfaction has dropped significantly. All the more reason we must prevail and keep adapting ourselves to make sure we deliver the best product we can.

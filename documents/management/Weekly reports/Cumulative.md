# Weekly Report - Week 1

This first week was focused on the initialization of the project and the planning of it. We also started doing research for the code and the different questions we had. There were also a few interactions with the client to ensure the quality of our work.  
One thing to point out is the fact we had additional time provided due to one of our teachers being absent.

## Accomplishments:
1. Kick-off
    - The client presented us with the project and what he expects from us.
2. Specifications
    - We currently have most of the functional specifications ready and started thinking about the technical ones.
3. Planning
    - The different tasks required for this project have mostly been defined. The timeline has been defined but not written down yet.
4. Research
    - The software team has researched Assembly, NASM, and DOSBox, the language and tools we are required to use. They successfully managed to run a "Hello World" and draw a square on the screen.
5. Test strategy
    - A good project cannot go smoothly without testing. Our QA team defined a strategy for testing with the different tools and tasks they will do.

## Challenges
1. New team & roles
    - This project started with a brand new team. Additionally, half of the team is composed of new students. Learning about each other is key to working correctly together.
    - Each person has been given a role, forcing us to learn about it and set ourselves in the correct mind, even harder for the new students who never did anything like this.
2. Legal matters
    - Creating a Pac-Man clone can pose some copyright and trademark infringement issues. This issue has been resolved by the client who informed us that they were accepting the risk.
3. Learning Assembly
    - Most of our team members never did Assembly. Learning it and more importantly, managing to think correctly about how to use it is quite a challenge, even with a book provided by our school director specialized in our project.

## Plan for next week
1. Finishing functional specifications and planning
    - The functional specifications must be completed (yet subject to changes as it is a living document) by Monday midday and sent to the client. One of the missing sections is the planning which should be completed by that time.
2. Drawing sprites
    - Since we are already able to draw on the screen, the next step is to draw sprites. One of the keys to do so is finding the right balance between screen size and color range, and later how to store the sprites in memory.
3. Risk evaluation
    - One of the priorities for next week is finding and defining in more detail the different risks that could occur during this project and how to handle them.

## Conclusion:

This project started off well and by working enough we should be able to meet the deadline, perhaps even having time to implement additional features.  
We are confident about the future and eager to see how this project will turn out and what we will learn from it.

# Weekly Report - Week 2

This second week was quite short (only two half-days) but on the flip side, we had a lot of courses on Assembly, which will help us greatly in making a qualitative project with the current timeline.

## Accomplishments:
1. Functional specifications
   - As required, we delivered the functional specifications to the client. Although they deemed the document not detailed enough, we have all the necessary information required to recreate a fidel copy of the original as requested.
2. Quality strategy
   - The QA team also continued their work on the testing plan and started applying their different strategies such as their weekly meeting.
3. Management
   - On the managerial side of things, the breakdown of the tasks and their planning is complete. The focus has been shifted to the Key Performance Indicators and the evaluation of risks.
4. First code
   - Thanks to the courses we had, we were able to write some code for our project during the classes (outside of our regular work schedule). This code has been tailored to our needs and is already available on the repository. We are now able to show any of the sprites anywhere on the screen.

## Challenges
1. Difficult project
   - With our lessons on Assembly, we realized that this project is actually more challenging than we originally thought.
   - Some aspects of the game we did not think about at first came up. The tasks we adjusted to reflect this, notably, a timer will be implemented soon to ensure the game runs at the right speed, which in turn will ensure the sprite's movement and animations will be flawless.
   - The main weak points of each team member came to light. Those will be treated or worked around with a close follow-up to have a smooth-running team.

## Plan for next week
1. Finishing technical specifications
   - Even if a bunch of progress was made on those, there is only one week to finish those. They will be one of the priorities of this week.
2. Player movement
   - Thanks to our great courses, we are ahead of schedule on the development side. The tasks that will be worked on are the movement of the player which requires the keyboard inputs to be read and the timer to wait the correct amount of time.
3. Management
   - As mentioned above, one of the goals for the following week is to have all the KPIs and risks fully defined.

## Conclusion:

Even though the functional specifications were not very well received, we are not letting ourselves be affected by this setback and will be making the most of the little advance we have.  
There is still a lot to be done but it is only the beginning of this journey.

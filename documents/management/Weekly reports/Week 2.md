# Weekly Report - Week 2

This second week was quite short (only two half-days) but on the flip side, we had a lot of courses on Assembly, which will help us greatly in making a qualitative project with the current timeline.

## Accomplishments

1. Functional specifications
   - As required, we delivered the functional specifications to the client. Although they deemed the document not detailed enough, we have all the necessary information required to recreate a fidel copy of the original as requested.
2. Quality strategy
   - The QA team also continued their work on the testing plan and started applying their different strategies such as their weekly meeting.
3. Management
   - On the managerial side of things, the breakdown of the tasks and their planning is complete. The focus has been shifted to the Key Performance Indicators and the evaluation of risks.
4. First code
   - Thanks to the courses we had, we were able to write some code for our project during the classes (outside of our regular work schedule). This code has been tailored to our needs and is already available on the repository. We are now able to show any of the sprites anywhere on the screen.

## Challenges

1. Difficult project
   - With our lessons on Assembly, we realized that this project is actually more challenging than we originally thought.
   - Some aspects of the game we did not think about at first came up. The tasks we adjusted to reflect this, notably, a timer will be implemented soon to ensure the game runs at the right speed, which in turn will ensure the sprite's movement and animations will be flawless.
   - The main weak points of each team member came to light. Those will be treated or worked around with a close follow-up to have a smooth-running team.

## Plan for next week

1. Finishing technical specifications
   - Even if a bunch of progress was made on those, there is only one week to finish those. They will be one of the priorities of this week.
2. Player movement
   - Thanks to our great courses, we are ahead of schedule on the development side. The tasks that will be worked on are the movement of the player which requires the keyboard inputs to be read and the timer to wait the correct amount of time.
3. Management
   - As mentioned above, one of the goals for the following week is to have all the KPIs and risks fully defined.

## Conclusion

Even though the functional specifications were not very well received, we are not letting ourselves be affected by this setback and will be making the most of the little advance we have.  
There is still a lot to be done but it is only the beginning of this journey

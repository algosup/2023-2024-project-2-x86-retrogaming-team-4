# Weekly Report - Week 5

Week five was quite a profitable one with much progress being made on the code. Our time was mostly spent trying to have a working prototype ready for delivery.

## Accomplishments:
1. Prototype ready
   - There were a lot of features in development that needed to be finished, mostly issues to be fixed. Most of it has been completed and we now have an almost fully working prototype ready to be handed off.
2. Quality improvements
   - Thanks to the re-repartition of tasks and a better focus on documentation, we are now more aware of each other's work and how the code works. This led to developing the code to be much easier and finding more features to fix and improve.

## Challenges
1. Quality
   - Forcing people to have the right mindset to have qualitative work is difficult. This is not helped by the fact that different people have different ideas and mindsets. By working together and trying to improve ourselves, we are slowly getting there.
2. Overwork
   - Most of the work this week was done at home, mostly during the weekend when something else was supposed to take place. This allows us to advance faster but might lead to overwork. Also during this time, we are not working together and there is no supervision which can lead to issues that will come back to backstab us.

## Plan for next week
1. Prototype polishing
   - On Monday, we will spend the day working on the prototype. We will start by reviewing the latest modifications and adding them. Then we will decide on which features we still have time to implement or keep for the final version.
2. Improvements
   - We already spent a lot of time writing documentation and improving the comments in the code. This effort must continue next week to hand over this project with relative ease.
   - Some parts of the code should be refactored such as one of the buffers' type whose change would save us code and memory space, as well as other data that should be moved outside of our code into a separate file.
3. Finishing features
   - There are still some features from the original game that are not implemented. We will focus on those first and foremost.

## Conclusion:

Even if this next week has two fewer work days than originally planned, we should be on our way to having a fully working and feature-complete project. We may even have time to add one or two additional features that we thought of but did not plan to add directly.

## Project Overview

ALGOSUP's school commissioned us to create a Pac-Man game clone in Assembly code. The software's primary objective is to completely fit all the original gameplay systems.

## Project scope

This software's primary objective is to create a clone of Pac-Man following all the guidelines of the original retro game using DOSBox.

## Risks and assumptions

## Solution overview

### System architecture

As requested by ALGOSUP, we are going to use DOSBox, an emulator for Intel 80386 family CPUs which is cross-platform and does not require any DOS distribution or an x86 architecture CPU.
Our game will be based on a 16 bits adress bus, limiting adressable RAM to 65,536 bytes.

### User interface

### Game mechanics

As we need to respect the original gameplay rules, we have to be focused on many aspects during development:

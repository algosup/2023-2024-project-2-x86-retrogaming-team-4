## Personas and use cases


### 1. Retro Gaming Enthusiast - Alex

- Goals:
  - Alex's primary goal is to experience a faithful recreation of the original Pac-Man game. He is looking for a challenge that closely mirrors the difficulty level of the original arcade version.
  - He want to relive the nostalgia of playing Pac-Man and appreciate the game's classic gameplay mechanics.

- Challenges:
  - Ensuring that the game's difficulty level closely matches that of the original Pac-Man can be a challenge, as it requires fine-tuning various gameplay elements.
  - Meeting the expectations of a dedicated retro gaming enthusiast like Alex, who may have a deep understanding and appreciation for the nuances of the original game.

### 2. Novice Player - Emily

- Goals:
  - Emily is interested in discovering and learning how to play Pac-Man for the first time. She wants an accessible experience that doesn't overwhelm her with complexity.
  - Her goal is to have fun while playing and potentially develop an interest in classic arcade games.

- Challenges:
  - Designing the game to be accessible and user-friendly for a novice player like Emily, while still maintaining the core essence and challenge of Pac-Man.
  - Balancing the game's difficulty so that it provides a satisfying challenge without becoming frustrating for someone new to the game.


### 3. Nostalgic 90s Gamer - Mike


- Goals:
  - Mike's main goal is to recapture the magic of the 90s arcade experience on his modern machine. He seeks an authentic recreation of Pac-Man. 

- Challenges:
  - Ensuring that the Pac-Man clone provides a seamless and enjoyable experience on Mike's new machine, taking into account any hardware or software compatibility issues.
  - Striking the right balance between preserving the retro charm of the original game and incorporating modern elements to enhance the overall gaming experience for Mike.



### 4. Tandy 1000 Enthusiast - Jason


- Goals:
  - Jason's primary goal is to experience Pac-Man on his Tandy 1000, as it's a system he holds dear to his heart.
  - He seeks a version of Pac-Man that is optimized for the [^2]Tandy 1000's hardware and provides an authentic 80s computing experience.

- Challenges:
  - Ensuring that the Pac-Man clone is compatible with the Tandy 1000's specific hardware configurations and limitations.
  - Fine-tuning the game's performance to run smoothly on the Tandy 1000, taking into account any potential resource constraints.


## Risks and assumptions

## Solution overview

### System architecture

As requested by ALGOSUP, we are going to use [^1]DOSBox, an emulator for Intel 80386 family CPUs which is cross-platform and does not require any DOS distribution or an x86 architecture CPU.
Our game will be based on a 16 bits adress bus, limiting adressable RAM to 65,536 bytes.

### User interface

### Game mechanics

As we need to respect the original gameplay rules, we have to be focused on many aspects during development:

- Graphisms: This includes sprites for both pac-man and ghosts, as well as map elements such as walls, pallets and bonus fruits
- Map creation and gestion: This includes creating a map, managing pellets, fruit cycles and other hazard on the map
- Gameplay: This includes moving, life system, score system and changes between levels
- Moving: This includes both pac-man and ghosts deplacements and collision
- Sound: This includes musics and sound effects
- Score: This includes score storing and keeping high scores

#### Graphisms

The game will take place on a [maze](docs\pictures\maze.png) of a size of 240 by 320 pixels

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|-----|-----|
| [^1]:| DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates an IBM PC compatible computer running a DOS operating system. |
| [^2]:| The Tandy 1000 was the first in a line of IBM PC compatible home computer systems produced by the Tandy. The Tandy 1000 is powered by an x86 processor operating on a 16-bit architecture. This means that it utilizes the Intel 8088, which is a 16-bit microprocessor compatible with the x86 instruction set.  |
